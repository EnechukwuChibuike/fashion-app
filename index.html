              <h2>HTML</h2>
              <p>
                We structure the web using HTML, which defines the content of a
                webpage, including text, images, and links. It's the foundation
                that organizes and presents information clearly to users.

              <p>
                We design the look and feel of your website with CSS, ensuring
                it is visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly. CSS
                allows us to control the layout, color schemes, fonts, and
                overall aesthetics of your site.

                JavaScript. From dynamic content updates to interactive forms
                and animations, JavaScript powers the engaging experiences that
                keep users connected and involved with your platform.

                LearnFactory has been a beacon of hope for a lot of youths who
                have the zeal and passion for software development and
                programming. From the inception, my experience at learnfactory
                has been nothing short of inspirational, from the online

                CSS and JavaScript, setting us up for a productive future and
                career. I'm glad I came to Learnfactory and met a lot of amazing
